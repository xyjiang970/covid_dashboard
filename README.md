# Simple Covid Dashboard

The ongoing repo from NYT containg Coronavirus (Covid-19) data in the United States can be <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data" target="_blank">found here</a>. 

Vaccine tracking information can be found from the Bloomberg <a href="https://github.com/BloombergGraphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-data" target="_blank">repo here</a>.

Both of the above resources were used in the making of this simple dashboard.

I will be looking at the breakdown of Covid-19 cases and vaccinations by <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/live/us-states.csv" target="_blank">state</a>.
