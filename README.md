# Simple Covid Dashboard

**IN PROGRESS**

The ongoing repo from NYT containg Coronavirus (Covid-19) data in the United States can be <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data" target="_blank">found here</a>. 

The ongoing vaccine tracking information can be found from the Bloomberg <a href="https://github.com/BloombergGraphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-data" target="_blank">repo here</a>.

<!-- For historical data (time series), I found Johns Hopkins University's ongoing <a href="https://github.com/BloombergGraphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-data" target="_blank">CSSE Covid-19 repo</a> especially useful.  -->

For ongoing NYC specific Covid data, everything can be found in <a href="https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data" target="_blank">this repo here</a>.

All of the above resources were used in the making of this simple dashboard.

I will be looking at the breakdown of Covid-19 cases and vaccinations with a foucs on NYC, and then from a national level (by state).
